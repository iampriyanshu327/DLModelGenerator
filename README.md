# DLModelGenerator
Under the name of this repo, I will be trying to build a Python project that could produce Deep Learning models, 

or atleast the Neural Network as per the demand of the 'User' 

(eg: Image Classification system, => then upload the training Data => it should return a .h5 file for the trained model and display the architecture of the model [on the UI])

Let's see how it goes.. ; )
